<h1>DFR Data Visualization Project</h1>

The main focus of this project was comparing RPM and wheel speed data to come up with an analysis.

In this first chart, it is comparing RPM over time. We can see 3 spikes in the graph showing that someone reved the
engine 3 separate times.

In this next chart it shows wheel speed over time. Again there are 3 spikes indicating that the car sped up and
slowed down 3 times.

The reason to why I compared the two was to see if in this test the person changed gears. After comparing these two graphs,
it is concluded that there was no change in gears.
If the person was changing gears, we would see RPM going up and down, but speed steadily increasing. Instead we see
RPM and wheel speed matching, which indicates that the engine was most likely being reved/no change in gears.


Here is another graph that shows RPM being compared to wheel speed

This graph further proves that there was no change in gears. As RPM gets higher, so does the speed of the car. You may
notice some stray points between 5000 to 9000 RPM and 5 to 25 wheel speed. This is most likely slippage due to rapid 
acceleration of RPM causing the wheel to loose traction which would result in a bad reading of speed.
